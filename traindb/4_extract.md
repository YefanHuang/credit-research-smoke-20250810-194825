# Regulatory Framework for Credit Rating Agencies
433In the wake of the ﬁ nancial crisis, countries across the globe have put in place or are considering new regulatory regimes designed to produce greater accountability, transparency and oversight for credit rating agencies. But as new regulations are developed, questions have surfaced. What are the goals of such regulation? How does one create a framework that avoids regulatory arbitrage? What can be done to reduce undue reliance on ratings? Credit ratings are intended to address one aspect of an investment decision—credit quality—although they are sometimes incorrectly used by investors for other purposes. It is important to recognize that they have a limited function and should not be unduly relied upon. Their role as opinions of the rela-tive creditworthiness of an issuer or issue is an important one, which is why regulation of them needs to be carefully considered and well-conceived. Standard & Poor’ s believes any new regulatory architecture should focus on the following goals: • Safety and soundness of ﬁ nancial markets • Business conduct based on transparency and fair dealing • Efﬁ cient and cost-effective regulation with alignment of responsi- bilities among different marketplace participants • Consistent regulation across similar businesses This article was published in the International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) Handbook, 2011.CHAPTER 17Regulating the Credit Rating Agencies RITA BOLGER ©International Monetary Fund.

# Regulation of Credit Rating Agencies to Enhance Market Confidence and Integrity
434 l Regulating the Credit Rating Agencies • Internationally consistent standards and coordinated enforcement • Adaptable to accommodate future innovations and changes in mar- ket structure • Analytically sound, independent, and unbiased credit ratings, in- cluding independence in establishing analytical criteria and meth- odologies and • Fair and healthy competition among rating agencies encouraging different views on creditworthiness to beneﬁ t investors. We believe that well-crafted regulation of credit rating agencies can serve to meet the goals described above. It can also enhance the ratings process and restore investor conﬁ dence through consistent application of practical and ﬂ exible standards coupled with appro- priate regulatory supervision. While regulation should never dic-tate how a rating agency performs its analysis, a well-functioning ratings process can beneﬁ t the economy as a whole by contribut- ing to greater investor conﬁ dence. In order to address areas where investors and policymakers have identiﬁ ed gaps and key issues in the current regulatory regime for credit rating agencies, we have highlighted below the signiﬁ cant investor concerns and expecta- tions we have heard and how we believe regulation might enhance the process. 1. Independently-derived, credible, and unconﬂ icted credit ratings Appropriate regulation that addresses the effective management of potential conﬂ icts of interest can only beneﬁ t the marketplace. This is an area where regulation can be particularly helpful by requiring credit rating agencies to promote ratings quality and market conﬁ dence, pro- vided that regulators protect analytical independence by avoiding rules and examination processes that interfere with the substance of ratings opinions and an agency’ s analytics. 2. The meaning and use of ratings should be clear Rating agencies should be transparent about the meaning and limi- tations of their ratings—for example, clarifying that credit ratings do ©International Monetary Fund.

# Regulatory Enhancements for Credit Rating Transparency and Accountability

Regulation that encourages transparency regarding the nature of rating agency opinions and pertinent information used in the ratings process could help enhance investor knowledge. 3. Consistency and comparability of ratings across asset classes and geographies—accountability for ratings quality Regulation that requires rating agencies to publicly disclose their ratings performance statistics across asset classes and geographies would aid market participants in assessing ratings quality. 4. Transparency and soundness of analysis Regulation that requires robust disclosure of the ratings process, including criteria and methodologies for assigning and updating rat- ings, would give investors additional information to make informed decisions, to compare ratings, and to form their own opinions on the soundness of an agency’ s analytics. Regulation could also require iden-tiﬁ cation of the models and underlying assumptions used in a rating agency’ s analysis. In addition, regulation that requires agencies to pub-licize their ratings performance statistics enhances the market’ s ability to draw comparisons across geographies, certain asset classes and with competitors and informs independent investor analysis. Rating agen-cies could add to this informational process by making personnel avail-able to explain their methodologies to users. 5. Ratings on different securities should be differentiated The ﬁ nancial crisis highlighted the need for markets to better un- derstand the meaning of ratings, including ratings on structured ﬁ nance securities, and how they differ from other ratings. Regulation could play a role in enhancing transparency about those differences. 6. Availability of information Rating agencies that operate under an issuer-pay business model receive conﬁ dential information from issuers and others throughout the ratings and surveillance process.

# Regulatory oversight and quality assurance in credit rating agencies
436 l Regulating the Credit Rating Agencies of conﬁ dential information would be consistent with current securi- ties regulation. Where markets and regulators believe the conﬁ dential information should be made available to a rating agency’ s competitors or to others, regulation should require issuers and others responsible for the quality of that data to make this information available to such parties. 7. Regulatory oversight Regulation that provides for regulatory authorities to check agen- cies’ compliance with their processes and policies can be beneﬁ cial to promoting ratings quality and market conﬁ dence, provided that regula- tors protect analytical independence by avoiding rules and examination processes that interfere with the substance of ratings opinions and an agency’ s analytics. 8. Competitive market for ratings with more and varying views on credit quality from qualiﬁ ed providers Ratings based on a high degree of integrity and intellectual rigor beneﬁ t the marketplace. A registration regime for rating agencies that follows globally consistent standards can be beneﬁ cial, but regulators should be transparent about the criteria they use in accepting applica-tions, including the need for sufﬁ cient analytical and ﬁ nancial resources. Regulation that requires disclosure about stafﬁ ng, number of ratings issued, and training requirements would allow regulators to make more informed decisions regarding the adequacy of an agency’ s resources. Regulators could also increase their ability to evaluate agencies by analyzing ﬁ nancial information from agencies provided to regulators on a conﬁ dential basis. However, regulators must protect analytical independence and not attempt to supplant their own judgments about ratings analysis for that of independent rating agencies. Evaluations as to the quality of ratings and ratings processes should be left ultimately to the market. Regulation of credit rating agencies remains important. While many steps have been taken, more work remains to be done. In particu-lar, the harmonization of existing regulation and proposed regulation will be critical. ©International Monetary Fund.

# Regulatory Framework and Conflict of Interest in Financial Markets
Rita Bolger l 437 Because the ﬁ nancial markets are global, a regulatory framework that provides consistent standards across jurisdictions can promote greater investor conﬁ dence and, ultimately, improved capital ﬂ ows and economic growth, maintain policies and procedures that address po-tential conﬂ icts of interest at the institutional and staff levels. These include a code of ethics that requires disclosure of potential conﬂ icts and how they are managed, with oversight of the code’ s effective ap- plication for all rating agency business models. Regulations could also prohibit activities that are clearly anticompetitive. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution
